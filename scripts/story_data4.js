        content: "Before the economic crisis hit, the trade council confirmed that they would be implementing a new protocol to assess the reliability of maritime routes. The director assumed that shipping companies would be monitoring the logistics sequence in real-time. It was established that they would be evaluating the cargo data to detect any underlying defects in the distribution framework. Many experts believed that this move would clarify the ambiguous trade laws between nations. Furthermore, the council promised that they would be maintaining strict safety regulations throughout the transition. However, a sudden lack of fuel meant that the ships would not be achieving the desired speed. They knew that a global panel would be critiquing the output if the criteria were not met, yet they persisted in the hope that the initial strategy would justify the high costs.",
