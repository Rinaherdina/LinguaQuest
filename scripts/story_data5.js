        title: "The Geopolitical Standoff",
        content: "Before the treaty was signed, analysts predicted that the two nations would have been engaging in a covert war for a decade. They assumed that the coalition would have been manipulating the global market to induce a recession in the rival state. By the time the peace talks commenced, the sanctions would have been devastating the domestic economy for years. It was expected that the council would have ratified the agreement to restore regional stability. Had the leaders maintained their tenacity, they would have been negotiating more favorable terms. However, the pervasive cynicism among the public precluded any quick reconciliation. Experts believed that the conflict would have transcended into a total war if the UN had not intervened. This standoff suggests that the sovereignty of small nations would have been being undermined consistently throughout the regime’s expansion.",
